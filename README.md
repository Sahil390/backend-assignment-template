# Waygood Study Abroad Candidate Evaluation Starter

This repository is a starter assignment for backend-focused MERN candidates interviewing with Waygood.

Waygood's public website positions the business around helping students discover universities, compare options, plan budgets, and navigate their study-abroad journey with AI-assisted tools and partner networks. This starter mirrors that business context by focusing on student discovery, recommendation, and application tracking.

## Business Scenario

You are joining the engineering team working on a study-abroad platform for students and counselors.

The product already has:

- a basic university and program catalog
- seeded sample data for students, universities, programs, and applications
- a minimal React dashboard shell
- starter backend architecture with Express, Mongoose, controllers, services, and middleware

The product is still missing critical engineering work needed for a real candidate-ready release.

## Your Assignment

Build on top of this starter and complete the platform features below.

### Required Tasks

1. Implement secure authentication

- Complete `POST /api/auth/register`
- Complete `POST /api/auth/login`
- Add a protected `GET /api/auth/me`
- Use JWT-based authentication
- Store passwords securely using hashing
- Support roles for `student` and `counselor`

2. Complete advanced university and program discovery

- Extend `GET /api/universities` and `GET /api/programs`
- Add filtering by country, intake, degree level, budget, scholarship availability, and search term
- Add pagination metadata and sorting options
- Make the response format consistent and frontend-friendly

3. Build a recommendation engine using MongoDB aggregation

- Improve `GET /api/recommendations/:studentId`
- Use MongoDB aggregation to recommend relevant programs for a student
- Consider preferred countries, budget, field of interest, intake, and IELTS score
- Return top matches with a short explanation of why each result matched

4. Implement the application workflow

- Complete `POST /api/applications`
- Complete `PATCH /api/applications/:id/status`
- Prevent duplicate applications for the same student, program, and intake
- Enforce valid status transitions
- Record a timeline/history entry when status changes

5. Add caching and performance improvements

- Cache `GET /api/universities/popular` and/or dashboard summary responses
- You may use Redis or improve the provided in-memory cache
- Add or document MongoDB indexes that improve the most important queries
- Keep performance tradeoffs clear in code comments or README notes

6. Add testing and developer documentation

- Add tests for at least 2 important API flows
- Include at least 1 edge-case test
- Update this README with any assumptions, setup steps, and architecture notes needed to review your submission

### Bonus Tasks

- Integrate an AI endpoint for study-plan suggestions, SOP helper prompts, or shortlist summaries
- Dockerize the backend and database setup
- Improve the React dashboard to consume your new APIs cleanly
- Add rate limiting, request logging, or role-based access improvements

## What We Will Evaluate

- Backend architecture and code organization
- API design, validation, and error handling
- MongoDB query quality, aggregation usage, and indexing awareness
- Performance thinking, including caching and response design
- Code readability, maintainability, and naming
- Testing depth and practical engineering judgment
- How well your solution reflects a real study-abroad product workflow

## Suggested Timebox

A strong submission can usually be completed in 6-8 focused hours. We care more about thoughtful engineering tradeoffs than feature volume.

## Suggested Submission Expectations

- Keep the solution realistic and production-minded
- Favor clean, explainable code over unnecessary complexity
- If you make assumptions, document them
- If you skip a bonus feature, that is okay
- Share your repository, setup instructions, and any sample credentials or environment notes needed to review

## Starter Project Structure

|-- backend
|   |-- src
|   |   |-- config
|   |   |-- controllers
|   |   |-- data
|   |   |-- middleware

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
copy .env.example .env
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

On macOS or Linux, use `cp .env.example .env` instead of `copy`.

## Environment Variables

See `backend/.env.example`.

## Seeded Data Included

The seed script creates sample:

- students with profile preferences
- universities across key study-abroad destinations
- programs with tuition, intake, and IELTS requirements
- applications with mixed statuses

## Sample Seed Credentials

After running the seed script, you can use:

- `aarav@example.com` / `Candidate123!`
- `sara@example.com` / `Candidate123!`
- `counselor@example.com` / `Candidate123!`

## Notes For Candidates

- Some routes are intentionally incomplete
- Some services are intentionally simple and should be improved
- The codebase is structured to show expected engineering direction, not to be finished
- You can refactor any part of the starter if your approach is better

## Candidate-Friendly Deliverables

Along with this README, a Word assignment brief is available at:

- `docs/Waygood_Candidate_Assignment.docx`

## Reference Context Used For This Assignment Design

- Waygood website: student discovery, AI tools, calculators, and partner-university positioning
- Job description: backend APIs, MongoDB aggregation, performance optimization, caching, and AI integration

## Candidate Submission Notes

### 1. Setup Instructions
I have containerized the entire stack for easy reviewer evaluation. To spin up the database, backend, and frontend concurrently without manual config:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
This will automatically map port `4000` to the Node backend, `5173` to Vite, and `27017` to MongoDB. 

> **Alternative Local Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running on port `27017` and run `npm run dev` in both frontend and backend directories.

_Testing:_ I've implemented a mocked Mongoose test suite using `jest` and `supertest`. To run the API critical flow tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

### 2. Architecture & Implementation Decisions
- **Authentication**: Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless sessions and `bcryptjs` hashing securely applied via a Mongoose pre-save hook.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Fully transitioned from the `O(N)` Javascript loop to a native **MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline**. This handles `matchScore` conditional summation (`$cond` and `$regexMatch`) directly within the database and sorts prior to returning.
- **Application Workflow**: Built out state transitions via a predefined mapping (`validStatusTransitions`). This strict mapping effectively guards against irregular data flows (e.g., jump from "draft" directly to "enrolled").

### 3. Performance & Optimizations
- Implemented robust MongoDB Compound Indexes in Mongoose schemas specifically for fields heavily hit during advanced discovery modes (like `{ country: 1, degreeLevel: 1, field: 1, tuitionFeeUsd: 1 }`).
- Leveraged the in-memory `MemoryCacheService` cache for endpoints that don't need real-time data accuracy, like `listPopularUniversities`.
